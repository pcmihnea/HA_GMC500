# What?
HomeAssistant integration of a GQ Electronics GMC500+ Geiger Muller Counter (GMC).  
May also work on other models from their [WiFi-enabled GMCs range](https://www.gqelectronicsllc.com/support/GMC_Selection_Guide.htm).  
 
# Why?
By design, GQ Electronics' WiFi-enabled Geiger counters are to be connect to the vendor's own global server, to provide a extensive mapping of [counters around the world](https://www.gmcmap.com/).  
The measurements are transmitted periodically as unsecured HTTP GET requests, with no prior authentication or even handshaking required.  
The device allows customizing a few parameters of the HTTP requests, most notably the destination ip/hostname. As such, local data sampling is possible as a faster and more reliable solution (no dependency on Internet resources).  

# How?

## 1. Configure the device
The Geiger counter can be configured on-device, via the buttons and LCD screen, but an easier option is via the official software, [GQ GMC Data Viewer](http://www.gqelectronicsllc.com/downloads/download.asp?DownloadID=61).  

- (Optional) Update firmware by [requesting the latest version from the manufacturer](https://www.gqelectronicsllc.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=8895).
- Connect to the PC is done via the mini-USB port - it will be enumerated as a CH340 USB-to-Serial device.
- In the main software window, configure the device model (i.e. GMC-500) and COM port, then open the `Other` window via the `Settings` menu.
- Input the WiFi access-point connection `SSID` and `Password`.
- The device sends a request in a defined structure, for example `http://www.GMCmap.com/log2.asp?AID=0230111&GID=0034021&CPM=15&ACPM=13.2&uSV=0.075`. Some parts are configurable (typos as present in the GUI):
	- Webite: IP/hostname of the local server (in example `www.GMCmap.com`) - set it to local server IP address, eg. `192.168.0.2` (the Home Assistant instance is running locally on the same WiFi network as the GMC)
	- URL: request URL (in example `log2.asp`) - set to a valid URL value, eg. `gmc500`
	- User ID: relevant if using the global server solution (in example `0230111`) - set it to a numeric value, eg. `555`
	- Geiger Counter ID: relevant if using the global server solution (in example `0034021`) - set it to a numeric value, eg. `01234`
	- Peroid: time between requests, in minutes - set it to preferred value, eg. `1`
	
## 2. Configure the server/relay
Since the Python script relies on non-standard libraries, a [Home Assistant Docker installation](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-container) is assumed to be already working.  
Also, a MQTT broker (for example Mosquitto) is also [installed](https://mosquitto.org/download), [configured](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html) and [accesible in HA](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/broker).  

- Install the required python libraries: `sudo pip install Flask paho_mqtt gunicorn` ([why gunicorn?](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying))
- Edit the `mqtt_gcm500.py` file by configuring the user-specific values as defined at step one (`GMC_USER_ID`, `GMC_DEVICE_ID`, `GMC_URL`) and accordingly to the used MQTT broker (`MQTT_HOSTNAME`, `MQTT_USERNAME`, `MQTT_PASSWORD`, `MQTT_CLIENT_ID`)
- Run the Python script as root: `sudo gunicorn mqtt_gmc500:app -b 0.0.0.0:80`
- (Optional) Configure the script to run at startup, for example by adding it to `/etc/rc.local`

## 3. Configure the HomeAssistant instance

- Add the following lines in `configuration.yaml` file (present inside the user-defined `homeassistant` configuration folder).  
Take note of the `state_topic` value, where `gmc500` is a example that shall be subtituted with the exact value of `MQTT_CLIENT_ID` parameter set at step 2.

```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: CPM
    unique_id: "gmc500_cpm"
    state_topic: "gmc500/sensors/values"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.CPM }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "cpm"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: uSV
    unique_id: "gmc500_usv"
    state_topic: "gmc500/sensors/values"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.uSV }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "Î¼SV"
```
- If all is well, after a HA restart the newly created sensors shall be available.
